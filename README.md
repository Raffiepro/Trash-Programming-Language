I present my amazing trash programming language inspired by Bash.
Special thanks to Python for inspiring me by letting me know that you don't have to make a good programming language to become famous,
just get people to make libraries! :]

You can include this magical hpp file and use it for games and stuff  
This is really bare bones and I swear I'll update it!!  
BUT AT LEAST THERE'S NO ANNOYING DLL'S AND LINKING!!!
  
Example:  
in name;  
out %name;out " is suspicious!!";  
set raffie pro;  
out %raffie;
